# We Are Open Badges
This repo contains Open badges the We Are Open Co-op issues. The Co-op issues badges to people who further [the International Cooperative Principles](http://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles). Initially, we are issuing badges that correspond with the outward facing principles numbers 5, 6 and 7:

## 5. Education, Training and Information
This principle states that co-operatives provide their peers with information about the structure and benefits of a 'co-op'. We issue a badge to people who contribute knowledge or time to co-op educational projects or programs. It is issued in line with Principle Five of  international co-operation. 

## 6. Co-operation among Co-operatives
This principle says that part of cooperation is working with others who work in cooperation. Meta, we know. We issue a badge to people who form relationships between co-operatives, and have organized a meeting or an event (either online or offline) that introduced two or more co-op members to one another. We also issue a badge to people who work on a joint project between. Both are issued in line with Principle Six of international co-operation. 

## 7. Concern for Community

To us, this principle is about our concern for the open community as well as the coop community. We work as a bridge between these movements. This badge is issued to people who are interested in co-operatives, and have attended a related event (either online or offline). It is issued in line with Principle Seven of international co-operation.
